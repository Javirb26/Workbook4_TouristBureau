It includes 2 pages being: Home, Form pages respectively. This project was built using HTML CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## Interesting Piece of Code
My favorite or most interesting piece of code from this project is actually pretty simple it is this line of code: Would definetly have to be both the categoryEl.onclick and acitivityEl.onclick function as they added interactivity to the page that I really hadn't done on a standalone project up until now.
